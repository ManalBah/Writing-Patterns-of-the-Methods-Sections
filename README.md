Exploring the Writing Patterns of the Methods Sections in the Microarray Analysis Literature using Discourse Analysis

Our aim is to look for patterns of functional discourse elements in how methods are described in a corpus of computational biology papers. A workflow of our method is shown in Figure 3.1.


An outline of our approach is as follows:
1. Collect a corpus of literature featuring microarray data analysis
2. Automatically annotate these papers with functional discourse tags 3. Extract the Methods section from these annotated papers
4. Analyse the discourse annotations for the patterns of discourse.
